# Senior Fall Detection Computer Vision Project

This project uses YOLOv8 to perform supervised object detection to identify if seniors have fallen in indoor locations. This is important in guaranteeing that seniors receive help as soon as possible; the faster fallen seniors receive help, the higher the possibility of recovery there is. Common use cases of this model are in smart home system cameras for seniors living alone, or in security cameras in senior care homes and hospitals. Our target audience are seniors, their family members, and medical staff.
